# Alpha-wave
This data was recorded in the laboratory to investigate the effect of visual activity on the alpha wave in the brain signal:

1- First, connect the Amplifier-Bio block to the main Powerlab unit.
2- Connect the recording electrodes.
3- Then open the chart software and in the Amplifier-Bio section, set the signal range to 200 microvolts, 50Hz notch filter, 1Hz high-pass filter and 50Hz low-pass filter. We also set the sampling frequency to 400 Hz.
4- We ask the person to be in a calm position, with his eyes closed and without muscle movement, and we start recording.
1- We ask the person to be in a calm position with his eyes closed and we record the signal.
2- Then we ask the person to open his eyes and record the signal for another 30 seconds.
3- Then we ask the person to close his eyes again and record for another 30 seconds.
4- By adjusting the time axis, we compare the two parts.
5- We obtain the power spectrum density using software.
6- Save the signal in MATLAB format.

The alpha wave is quite visible in the closed-eye mode and has a much larger amplitude compared to the open-eye mode.
